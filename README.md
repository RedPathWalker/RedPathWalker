### Hi there 👋

<!--
**RedPathWalker/RedPathWalker** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a shell script to help simplify selecting digital/voice memory locations on Kenwood TM V71a radios using applications created by Steve Magnuson, AG7GN, supporting the Nexus DR-X Pi stack in our local ACS comm room.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning shell scripting, python, github and when to not volunteer my life away.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on we'll see.  Right now I am terrified by my own incompetence.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with pretty much everything new I try.
- 💬 Ask me about, probably not a good idea my brain is too much like a rabbit hole.
- 📫 How to reach me: Please don't try.
- 😄 Pronouns: I guess I am fine whatever works for you.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm not much fun.
