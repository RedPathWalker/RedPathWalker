### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**RedPathWalker/RedPathWalker** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a shell script to help simplify selecting digital/voice memory locations on Kenwood TM V71a radios using applications created by Steve Magnuson, AG7GN, supporting the Nexus DR-X Pi stack in our local ACS comm room.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning shell scripting, python, github and when to not volunteer my life away.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on we'll see.  Right now I am terrified by my own incompetence.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with pretty much everything new I try.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about, probably not a good idea my brain is too much like a rabbit hole.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Please don't try.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: I guess I am fine whatever works for you.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm not much fun.
